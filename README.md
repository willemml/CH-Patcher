# CH-Patcher

Helper plugin for [CH-Decryptor](https://github.com/willemml/CH-Decryptor). Publicizes some
methods and removes function calls that require full game initialization and integrity checks.

Install it by dropping `Patcher.dll` (which can be found in the GitHub releases) into
the BepInEx `patchers` directory.
